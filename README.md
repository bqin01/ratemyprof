# Rate My Prof

A tool to help students (and all others interested) make more meaningful queries about universities and their professors on the scraped data found from the [Rate My Professors Official Site](ratemyprofessors.com).

**Note: This was implemented with the assumption that the [Rate My Professors API](https://github.com/shafi-dayatar/rmp-api) is still functional. However, the last time the API was updated was on August 8th, 2016 and has not been updated to reflect the new way professors are being given grades on the site. As such, I have opted to create my own scraper.**

According to the Rate My Professors website's Terms of Use under "Section 6: Rules of Conduct", it is prohibited to,

As permission has **NOT** been attained, *this project has been put on hold indefinitely until such permission is gained*.
